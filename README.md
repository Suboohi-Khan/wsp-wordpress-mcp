WSP MCP is a **free MCP plugin for WordPress**. Install it, connect your AI app, and just ask:

- *"Write a blog post about our summer sale and save it as a draft."*
- *"Find every page missing a meta description and suggest one."*
- *"Show me this week's WooCommerce orders and mark the shipped ones as completed."*
- *"Add a Contact link to the main menu."*

**Why WSP MCP?**

- 💸 **100% free** — every feature and all 200+ tools, no paid version.
- 🔌 **Everything built in** — no companion plugin, MCP Adapter, or account needed.
- 🤖 **Works with your AI app** — Claude (web, desktop, mobile), ChatGPT, Cursor, Codex, Google Antigravity, OpenClaw, OpenCode, and any other MCP client.
- 🛡️ **Safe by default** — every tool has its own on/off switch, anything that changes your site is off until you turn it on, and the AI can only do what its WordPress user is allowed to do.
- 📋 **See everything the AI did** — a built-in Audit Log and usage dashboard, stored in your own database.

> **What is MCP?** The Model Context Protocol is the standard way AI assistants connect to other apps. Once your site has an MCP plugin, any AI app that supports MCP can read and update your site — with your permission.

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** WordPress 6.9+ (7.0.3 or 6.9.6+ recommended), PHP 7.4+ — **that's it.** Claude Desktop and OpenClaw use the `mcp-remote` bridge, which needs Node.js 18+; Cursor, Codex, Antigravity, and OpenCode connect natively.

1. Install & activate this plugin
2. Go to **MCP > Settings** in wp-admin and enable the abilities you need
3. Go to **MCP > Connection** and pick your client:
   - **Claude (claude.ai, Desktop, or mobile):** enable the OAuth server on the **Claude Connectors** tab, then paste just the server URL into **Customize > Connectors > Add custom connector** and sign in with your WordPress account
   - **Everything else (Cursor, Codex, Antigravity, OpenClaw, OpenCode):** use the Configuration Generator, then **Copy** or **Download** the snippet — the endpoint URL and credentials are already filled in — and paste it into your client's config (Cursor also gets a one-click **Connect Cursor Automatically** button)
4. Reconnect / restart the client and start prompting your AI agent
5. Review what your agent actually did under **MCP > Audit Log**, and check usage and response times under **MCP > Analytics**

> **Upgrading from before v2.0?** The legacy MCP-Adapter / Abilities-API path and the **MCP > Config Files** page were removed in v2.2. Re-create your connection using the native endpoint on **MCP > Connection**.

> **ChatGPT:** ChatGPT connects through the same OAuth sign-in as Claude Connectors — enable the OAuth server on **MCP > Connection**, then add your site's MCP URL as a connector in ChatGPT.

## ✨ What's New in v2.9.5

- 🧭 **Site Context** — new **MCP > Context** page: write `AGENTS.md` (how your site is built, rules for agents) and `CHANGELOG.md` (what changed and why), switch on **Enable Site Context** (off by default), and every connected agent reads them first instead of exploring the whole site — fewer tokens, less time. Delivered as server instructions on connect, via the `wsp_get_site_context` tool, and as MCP resources. Reconnect the client after editing; don't store secrets in these documents.
- 🛒 **WooCommerce store management** — 34 new tools: delete products, variations, coupons, categories and tags (trash by default); manage product categories, tags, global attributes and terms; read and update store settings, tax rates, shipping zones and methods, and payment gateways. Products can now be created and updated with categories, tags and attributes. Secrets (keys, tokens, passwords) are always masked.
- 🔌 **Plugin management** — install a plugin from WordPress.org or an https .zip URL, update it, or delete it (must be deactivated first). Administrators only.
- All new tools are **off by default** — enable them in MCP > Settings.

## v2.9.4

- 🎨 **Site Editor tool group** — six tools for block themes: read and update Global Styles (colors, typography, spacing, style variations) and list, read, create and update block templates and template parts.
- 🧱 **Widgets & Sidebars tool group** — eight tools for classic themes: list widget areas and types, and read, create, update, move and delete widgets.
- 🩺 **Site Health, Cron & Error Log tool group** — six diagnostics tools: run Site Health checks, list/inspect/run/unschedule WP-Cron events, and read recent PHP/WordPress error-log lines (secrets redacted).
- 📦 **Upload / Install Theme** — install a theme your AI generated (or a theme .zip) and optionally activate it. Administrators only.
- All new tools are **off by default** — enable them in MCP > Settings. The plugin now ships **200+ tools**.

## v2.9.3

- 🗂️ **Custom Post Types tool group** — five new tools: list your public custom post types, then list, create, update, and trash their items. Each item is checked against the post type's own permissions (a Contributor can't edit others' items or publish; an Author can't touch types like products that need extra rights). **Off by default.** Contributed by [@dulaj44](https://github.com/dulaj44) in [#43](https://github.com/bilalnaseer/wsp-wordpress-mcp/pull/43).
- 👋 **About Us page** under MCP, plus **Settings | Connection | About Us** links on the Plugins screen.
- ✏️ **Plain-language name, description and readme** — "WSP MCP - Free MCP Plugin for WordPress: Connect Claude, ChatGPT & AI Agents".

## v2.9.2

- Minor updates.

## v2.9.1

- 👥 **Create / Update Users** — add new users (password auto-generated if you don't supply one, role defaults to `subscriber`) and edit email, display name, role, or password. Require `create_users` / `edit_users`; **off by default**.
- ⚙️ **Update Site Info & Permalinks** — change the site title, tagline, and admin email, and set the permalink structure (e.g. `/%postname%/`). Require `manage_options`; **off by default**.
- 🔌 **Activate / Deactivate Plugins** — toggle any installed plugin by its file path (e.g. `akismet/akismet.php`). This plugin refuses to deactivate itself so the MCP connection can't cut itself off. Require `activate_plugins`; **off by default**.
- 🎨 **Themes tool group** — list installed themes and switch the active theme. Require `switch_themes`; **off by default**.

Contributed by [@dulaj44](https://github.com/dulaj44) in [#42](https://github.com/bilalnaseer/wsp-wordpress-mcp/pull/42).

## v2.9.0

- 🧭 **Navigation Menus tool group** — nine new tools to list menus and their items, create and delete menus, add / update / remove menu items (custom links, posts, pages, categories), list your theme's menu locations, and assign or unassign a menu to a location. Require `edit_theme_options`; **off by default**. Contributed by [@dulaj44](https://github.com/dulaj44) in [#41](https://github.com/bilalnaseer/wsp-wordpress-mcp/pull/41).
- 📄 **Read Post tool** — fetch a single post by ID in **any** status (draft, pending, private, trash) with its full content, so an agent can review a draft before updating it. Enforces per-post read permission; **off by default**. Closes [#38](https://github.com/bilalnaseer/wsp-wordpress-mcp/issues/38).
- 🐛 **Audit Log accuracy** — permission-denied results from the new Read Post tool are now logged as denied, not success.
- 🐛 **Add Menu Item validation** — an `object_id` whose post type doesn't match the requested `type` is now rejected instead of silently stored.

**Recent releases:** v2.9.0 — Navigation Menus tool group + Read Post tool · v2.8.0 — one-click Claude Connector sign-in (OAuth 2.1) + Analytics dashboard · v2.7.1 — object-level authorization on write tools (Patchstack) · v2.7.0 — Audit Log · v2.6.x — WPForms, Contact Form 7, Gravity Forms, UAE, Elementor design tools.

📋 **Full history:** see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## 🔐 Security model

- **Off by default** — every write ability is disabled until an administrator enables it in **MCP > Settings**.
- **Per-tool capability checks** — each tool declares the WordPress capability it requires (`edit_posts`, `manage_options`, `manage_woocommerce`, …) and runs as the connected WordPress user, so an agent can only do what that account can do.
- **Per-object guards** — tools that take a post/page/media ID additionally enforce ownership (`edit_post` / `delete_post` / `read_post`) and post type, matching WordPress core's own REST checks.
- **Three auth methods** — OAuth 2.1 (one-click Claude Connector, off by default), WordPress Application Passwords, or a plugin-generated API key.
- **Audit Log** — every `tools/call` is stored in `wp_wsp_mcp_audit_log` with user, IP, outcome (success / denied / error), and duration. Nothing leaves your server. Auto-pruned after 90 days.
